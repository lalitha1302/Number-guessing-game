#  Number Guessing Game (Python)
-using nummpy skills

##  Overview
This is a simple and fun, **Number Guessing Game** implemented in Python.  
The program generates a random number between **1 and 100**, and the player has to guess it.  
After each guess, the program provides feedback:
- `"too low!"` if the guess is smaller than the number
- `"too high!"` if the guess is larger than the number
- `"Correct!"` when the player guesses the number correctly  

It also tracks the number of attempts taken to guess the correct number.
